# OpenCV SPM Package

Every time I try to use OpenCV on an Apple platform, I lose a few days to yak shaving trying to
get it to compile and including it in my project.  The build process is convoluted and
time-consuming -- there is no way to turn it into a Swift Package.

But now, one can create [*binary* packages in SPM]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-binary-frameworks-as-swift-packages ).

So here it is.

To use it, just include the package <br/>
